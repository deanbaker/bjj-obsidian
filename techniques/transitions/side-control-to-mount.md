# Side Control to Mount Transition

## Setup
### Initial Position
- Established side control
- Chest-to-chest connection
- Head control with near-side arm
- Far-side hip controlled

### Grips Required
- Near-side arm controlling opponent's head/shoulder
- Far-side underhook or crossface
- Optional: Far-side gi grip if in gi

### Body Position
- Hips low for base
- Knees tight to opponent's body
- Weight distributed forward

## Execution
### Standard Technical Mount Entry
1. Control near-side arm to prevent frames
2. Slide knee closest to head up toward armpit
3. Keep pressure forward to prevent bridging
4. Slide far-side leg across hips while maintaining pressure
5. Settle into mount with knees tight to armpits

### Alternative: Knee Slide Entry
1. Control far-side hip with hand
2. Step far-side knee over belly
3. Quickly slide remaining leg across while maintaining pressure
4. Establish mount position before opponent can bridge

## Key Details
- Maintain forward pressure throughout transition
- Keep elbows tight to prevent frames
- Don't lose head control during transition
- Time the transition when opponent is flat
- Be ready to float if they bridge

## Common Counters & Solutions
| Counter | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Bridge during transition | Float with bridge, complete mount as they return |
| Frame creation | Control arms before initiating transition |
| Hip escape/shrimp | Cut knee across body earlier in transition |
| Half guard recapture | Keep weight on crossface, free leg with hip pressure |

## Variations
- Knee-on-belly transition first
- S-mount entry
- Step-over mount when opponent turns away

### Need to Improve

## Drilling Ideas
1. Static transition practice
2. Transition after submission attempt
3. Flow drill: Side control → KOB → Mount
4. Recovery practice when caught mid-transition

## Competition Application
- Best timing for transition
