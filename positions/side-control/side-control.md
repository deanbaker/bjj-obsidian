### Transitions
- To mount
- To north-south
- To knee-on-belly
- To back control

## Defensive Considerations
### Common Escapes to Prevent
- Frame and shrimp
- Bridge and roll
- Underhook recovery
- Half guard recovery

### Maintaining Position
- Weight distribution
- Hip control points
- Common mistakes to avoid
  - Leaving space under hips
  - Losing head control
  - Poor pressure direction

## Training Notes
### What's Working
